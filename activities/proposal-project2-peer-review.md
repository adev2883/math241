- Describe the goal of the project.

Using survey data to explore whether or not the Conservative Party's rule in the United Kingdom will end. The main question asks what the party outcome for the next general election be in the United Kingdom. 



- Describe the data used or collected.

The data is from Redfield & Wilton Strategies, a market researcher based in London. It looks like they have survey data based on answers from constituents in the United Kingdom. 


- Describe how the research question will be answered, e.g. what approaches / methods will be used.

They will use the data collected from consitutents' answers to the survey questions to explore what the party outcome for the next general election will be in the United Kingdom. They will simulate a series of possible outcomes, althought it is not quite clear what type of simulation method they'll be using. 


- Is there anything that is unclear from the proposal?

The type of simulation methods they plan on using. 



- Provide constructive feedback on how the team might be able to improve their project.

Decide what simulation methods to use. Furthermore, it looks like you all are doing something pretty novel so maybe make your files in R such that they would be able to be used by others...?



- What aspect of this project are you most interested in and would like to see highlighted in the presentation.

We think the outcome of the simulations in general will be very interesting. 



- Provide constructive feedback on any issues with file and/or code organization.

Not sure how big of a deal this is, but we noticed that the proposal was in html format and not in the qmd file. Other than that, looks good!


- (Optional) Any further comments or feedback?
